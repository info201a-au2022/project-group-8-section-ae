# Dynamic Paragraph
TEST `r summary_info$num_observations`
Top_10_Netflix_weekly:
`r top_10_netflix_weekly_dataset`

In the first data set, we were able to find a list of films and TV shows that stayed the most viewed on Netflix in different countries through for multiple weeks. We found that in the film, `r movie_that_stayed_10_on_netflix_longest` was the film that stayed on Netflix's top 10 most viewed movie for the longest time and found `r show_that_stayed_10_on_netflix_longest` to be the TV show's that stayed on the top 10 most viewed for the longest time. 


In the second data set, the data shows different Netflix's subscription fees in different countries, we found that `r country_with_lowest_fee_on_netflix_subscription` to have the lowest subscription fee of the basic package. But in `r country_with_highest_fee_on_netflix_subscription` they are the countries with the highest basic Netflix package fees.


In the third data set, we are able to see the stocks of Netflix over the past 19 years, we could `r number_dates_collected_from_02_21` number of dates. With this information, we are able to find out why and how Netflix became the number one streaming platform.


## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
