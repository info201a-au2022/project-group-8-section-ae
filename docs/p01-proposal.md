# Impact of Netflix on Human Connections


**TODO**: Edit this file. Your project proposal goes here.

### **Abstract**

Our main question is how does Netflix have an impact on the social and economical welfare in the world. This question is important because as there are so many streaming services many people could access, Netflix tends to stay at number 1. We will address these questions by breaking
down the best qualities of Netflix and why it has people's grip.

_Human Values_

  Our topic is the effect of Netflix and streamed content on the emotional and social lives of humans. In today's world, humans are deeply connected to each other through screens and content. Streaming movies and shows allows humans to spread and share information about different topics and scenarios. In this project, we want to study how the human values of being social, empathetic, and progressive, are all influenced by content online. An example is how people connected online through the pandemic using Netflix Party, now known as Teleparty. The chat features, along with being able to stream content simultaneously, allowed for connectivity and comfort. Humans naturally want to thrive and be educated, and a result is we stream content for entertainment and to better our knowledge. This could be watching a documentary on Netflix or a tutorial on YouTube.

_Direct and Indirect Stakeholders_

  Direct stakeholders include the users of content on Netflix, such as account owners and families. They have the potential to be directly impacted by Netflix and its streaming availability, as listed in the next subsection of possible harms/benefits.
  Indirect stakeholders include those who may not use Netflix directly, such as founders, employees, and investors. They are affected by the effect of Netflix and its content on others, including monetary rewards and social impacts ("Strategy"). Additionally, as creators of the platform, they are impacted by the climate effect, and so are direct stakeholders, or any other inhabitant of the Earth ("True Impacts").
_Possible Harms and Benefits_
  Although streamed content can bring people together, and be educational, there are possible harms to the availability of content online. Here are some, listed below:
    * The amount of horror and dark content can be emotionally difficult for some people
    * Content can be distracting from other responsibilities, resulting in distance (Dhiman and Malik)
    * Readily content can be too vulgar and too in-depth for humans, for example the new Jeffrey Dahmer series
      * Adding on to the point above, this is an example of when capitalism encourages valuing fame and money over acknowledging the wishes of victims' and their families
    * Too many options and content can be overwhelming and distracting
    * Can completely change your lifestyle (Dhiman and Malik)
    However, there are many more possible benefits to be mentioned:
    * Easily available content can be used as a coping mechanism for those suffering with mental illness and other hardships
    * Softer shows can be comforting and educational

### **Limitations (Medha)**
Possible limitations include restrictions on what analysis can be conducted from the available data. Here are more listed below:
  * Privacy issues on user data being used without consent
    * People and their streaming habits are used for analysis
  * Only certain data is available -> Some data is private and restricted to the public for viewing
  * There are much larger sociotechnical impacts on people and their lives, although Netflix and other available streaming content does have an effect
    * We want to help meet others' needs and preferences, but we are limited in the amount of impact we can make on others
  * Some data sets are private, and we cannot use those in our exploration

### **Research Questions**

**What are some frustrations that come up with using different streaming services?**
* This question is important because to know what makes Netflix special and why people choose Netflix, we have to understand people's frustrations to see if itâ€™s something that Netflix or their competitors do. What motivates the questions is that if someone doesn't like something, they won't stay. So what is making people stay at Netflix?

**How do people choose the best streaming service for themselves/ families? What do they take into consideration and what do you wish Netflix had that other streaming services do?**


* This question is important to look into because Netflix offers different films for different audiences. We must understand what makes a person choose that platform for themselves or if they chose it for a family and why. What motivates the questions is seeing what age groups or audiences mainly use streaming services.

**What types of films do people most enjoy watching?**

* It is important to see what types of shows and movies people like watching because not every film is on the same service. By finding this out, we are able to see what keeps people connected to Netflix

**What makes Netflix different from other streaming services?**

* There are so many streaming services out there. Why do people choose Netflix? What makes them enjoy it over Hulu, Disney +, HBO Max, etc. This is all important to find out and motivates us to find out what it is that Netflix does that makes people happy.

**Expected implications**

* Some expected implications we see happening are designers and policymakers changing the different frustrations people had to fit more of their needs and preferences. I also see policymakers finding a way to add more films that people enjoy watching or films that give the same feeling as they were describing and comparing different streaming services to Netflix to find their strengths and weaknesses to better improve Netflix over all. After hearing feedback and or a comment, we should aim to find a way that fits those needs and preferences. Even though Netflix is the number one streaming service in the world, there is always room for improvement. Staying at the top, in a positive way,  is always something a company wants. By taking this feedback and research, we are able to figure out how Netflix stays on top and will continue to do so.
